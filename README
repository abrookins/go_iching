This is a simple experiment with Go: an I Ching oracle.

Build the package with `go build` and run the `iching` binary. It simulates the
traditional three-coin method of building six lines that form a hexagram, then
prints information about the hexagram, including external links to a couple of
well-known translations. If the hexagram is "changing" into another hexagram, it
finds that hexagram and prints its information as well.

Right now it works on the command line, though my end goal is a JSON API.
