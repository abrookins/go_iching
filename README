This is a simple experiment with Go: an I Ching oracle. 

Build the package with `go build` and run the `iching` binary. It simulates the
traditional three-coin method of building six lines that form a hexagram, then
prints information about the hexagram, including external links to a couple of
well-known translations.

Right now it works on the command line, though my end goal is a JSON API.
