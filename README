This is a simple experiment with Go: an I Ching oracle.

Use the package by importing it:

    import "iching"

Then run `iching.GetReading()`:

    question := "Is this a bubble?"
    reading := iching.GetReading()

`iching.GetReading()` which takes a question (a string) and
returns an `iching.Reading` object. `iching.GetReading()` simulates the
traditional three-coin method of building six lines that form a hexagram. Once
it has the lines, it finds an `iching.Hexagram` object that matches the
arrangement of the lines and, if the lines are "changing" (per the I Ching
divination rules), it calculates the next hexagram.

These values are included in the `iching.Reading` object (Question, Lines,
Hexagram and NextHexagram).

    // Obviously, import "fmt" first ...
    fmt.Println(reading.Question)
    fmt.Println(reading.Lines) 

`iching.Hexagram` objects include the (boolean) lines, the unicode
representation of the hexagram and have methods that return external links to a
couple of well-known translations of the hexagram.

    fmt.Println(reading.Hexagram.Character)
    fmt.Println(reading.Hexagram.Num)
    fmt.Println(reading.Hexagram.Name)
    // etc.

I'm working on a JSON API to wrap this library.
